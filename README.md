## About The App

Weather_App is a Weather and Forecasting app developed using ReactJs and multiple other industry trending technologies. It is a frontened only app developed to showcase my skills and learnings in ReactJs. This app has helped me practice my learnings and gain useful experience on handling APIs and CSS framework like TailwindCss
